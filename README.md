# Hackfest 2017 Challenges

This repository contains most of the Hackfest 2017 CTF challenges for the
`Cat o' Nine Tails` track including their writeups.

Challenges include :
 - (25 points)  EZ Flag Reloaded
 - (50 points)  Repeater
 - (75 points)  Baby SQLi
 - (100 points) Simple Blog
 - (100 points) I <3 PHP
 - (100 points) Automated Reversing
 - (300 points) RC LIFE
 - (400 points) The Impossible Quiz

With the exception of the `Automated Reversing` challenge, each challenge
is a docker container and can be deployed with the `docker-compose up`
command.

Each folder has a `readme.md` file containing the solution.


### [Coming soon]

Since nobody solved The PHP Litter Box (500 points), I've decided to host the
challenge on [RingZer0Team](ringzer0team.com) instead so you can give it
another try.
